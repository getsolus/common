   Rebuild template script for rebuilding packages on Solus.

   Please read and edit the script with the appriate parameters before starting.
   Generally only the MAINPAK and PACKAGES variables will need to be set where MAINPAK
   is the package you are rebuilding against and PACKAGES are the packages that need to
   be rebuilt against it. You'll also want to copy and rename it appropriately before using.

   Usage: ./rebuild-package.sh {setup,clone,bump,build,verify,commit,publish,NUKE}

   Explaination of commands:

   setup   : Creates a build repo for the rebuilds in as well as a custom local repo to place the resulting
           : eopkgs in. A custom local repo is used to isolate the standard local repo from the ongoing rebuilds.
           : The custom repo configuration can be found in /etc/solbuild/ after running setup.
           : If desired the custom repo can be edited to isolate it from the local repo in addition.
   clone   : Clones all the packages in PACKAGES to the build repo (make package.clone).
   bump    : Increments the release number in the package.yml file on all packages in the build repo (make bump)
   build   : Iteratively builds all packages in PACKAGES. If the package already exists in the local
           : repo it will skip to the next package. Passwordless sudo is recommended here so it can run unattended.
   verify  : Uses a git diff tool of choice to verify the rebuilds e.g. to verify abi_used_libs has changed in all packages.
   commit  : Git commit the changes with a generic commit message.
   publish : Iteratively runs makes publish to push the package to the build server,
           : waits for the package to be indexed into the repo before pushing the next.
           : You may wish to use autopush instead.

   NUKE    : This will nuke all of your work and cleanup any created files or directories.
           : This should only be done when all work has been indexed into the repo. Use with caution!"

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Miscellaneous Options:

   moveLocaltoRepo : Move all the packages in the custom local repo (/var/lib/solbuild/local/MAINPAK/*.eopkg) back to their
                     build repos from where they originated. If patterns are used to create a completely different subpackage name
                     this may fail for those packages. This option can be useful for updating abi reports.
   moveRepotoLocal : Move all the packages from their build repo of origin to the custom local repo (/var/lib/solbuild/local/MAINPAK/).
   package_count   : Count the total number of packages that are marked to be rebuilt.
   checkDeleteCache: If disk usage of the root partition is above 80%, then solbuild delete-cache --all will be run to free up disk space.
                     This is checked periodically during build.
